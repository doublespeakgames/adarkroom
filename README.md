A Dark Room for Electron
==============

A cross platform desktop version of A Dark Room running on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io). 


Uses a fresh copy of the game (stored locally), and the [Electron Boilerplate by szwacz](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate).


Still rough and won't work perfectly. Waste time at your own risk!
